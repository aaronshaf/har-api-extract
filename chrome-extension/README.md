### Understanding the Output

The extension generates XML-formatted output optimized for LLM analysis:

```xml
<api_requests total="5" graphql="2" rest="3">
  <request index="1" type="rest">
    <url method="POST">https://api.example.com/users</url>
    <status code="200" duration="145ms"/>
    <request_body>
      {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
    </request_body>
    <response>
      {"id": 123, "name": "John Doe", "status": "created"}
    </response>
  </request>
  
  <request index="2" type="graphql">
    <url method="POST">https://api.example.com/graphql</url>
    <operation>GetUserProfile</operation>
    <graphql_query>
      query GetUserProfile($id: ID!) {
        user(id: $id) { name email avatar }
      }
    </graphql_query>
    <variables>
      {"id": "123"}
    </variables>
    <response>
      {"data": {"user": {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}}}
    </response>
  </request>
</api_requests>
```

## Limitations

- **Size limits** - Large request/response bodies are truncated to 100KB to prevent memory issues
- **HTTPS only** - Some sites may require HTTPS to allow debugging
- **DevTools conflict** - Cannot record while Chrome DevTools is open on the same tab
- **Cross-origin** - Cannot capture requests from iframes with different origins

## Troubleshooting

### "Debugger is already attached"
- Close Chrome DevTools for the tab you're trying to record
- Only one debugger can be attached at a time

### "No API requests found"
- Ensure the page is making JSON or GraphQL requests
- Check Network tab in DevTools to verify requests are being made
- Try reloading the page after starting recording

### Extension doesn't appear
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Try reloading the extension
- Check for errors in the extension's background page console

### Recording gets stuck on "Processing"
- This usually means the captured data is too large
- Try recording fewer requests or shorter sessions
- Check the extension's background page console for errors

## Privacy & Security

- **Local processing only** - All data processing happens locally in your browser
- **No data transmission** - The extension never sends your data anywhere
- **Temporary storage** - Captured data is cleared when you close the popup
- **No permissions abuse** - Only requests minimal required permissions

## Development

### Building from Source

The extension is written in vanilla JavaScript and doesn't require a build step. To modify:
